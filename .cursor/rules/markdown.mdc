# When asked to refine "Prompts":
Aggressively apply Occam's Razor to distill the core instruction.

# When asked to refine "Documents":

## Format
```md
# Introduction
... WHY ...
# Overview
... **decriptivetitle1** ... **decriptivetitle2** ...
# DecriptiveTitle1
# DecriptiveTitle2
```

## Generate **step-by-step**:
- Step 1: Write the Introduction of Why.
- Step 2: Compose the Overview. Identify and bold any key terms that require detailed explanation later.
- Step 3: Create a separate, structured, self-contained section for each bolded term from the `Overview`.
- Step 4: Remove any modifiers or exaggerations in each section to focus on describing only the necessary "How" and "What".
- Step 5: Perform a strict revision of the entire document to remove all redundant, exaggerated, and superfluous language.
