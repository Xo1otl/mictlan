    "### 2.3 Coupled-Mode Equations\n",

    "The coupled-mode theory provides a powerful tool for the theoretical analysis of problems where distributed coupling between optical waves is involved [2,1]-[2.6], [2.10],[2.12], [2.18],[2.20]. A similar theory employed to analyze NLO interactions was given in the seminal paper by Armstrong et al. [2,21]. In this section, we derive the coupled-mode equations in such a form that they are convenient for analysis of nonlinear-optic interactions in waveguides.\n",

    "#### 2.4.1 Coherence Length and Phase Matching\n",

    "Figure 11 illustrates one-dimensional traveling-wave SHG described by (2.59)-(2.63). The second-harmonic component of the NLO polarization $\\bm{P}^{2\\omega}$ at each point in the medium gives rise to generation of wavelet at frequency $2\\omega$ which propagates in the medium. The total SHG results from accumulation of the harmonic wavelets from all points where the pump wave propagates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The phase distribution of $\\bm{P}^{2\\omega}$ along the $z$ axis is described by a phase constant $2\\bm{\\beta}^{\\omega}$, since $\\bm{P}^{2\\omega}$ is proportional to square of $E^{\\omega}$ propagating with phase constant $\\bm{\\beta}^{\\omega}$.

If $\\bm{\\beta}^{2\\omega} = 2\\bm{\\beta}^{\\omega}$ ($N^{2\\omega} = N^{\\omega}$) so that $\\Delta = 0$ and $L_{c} \\rightarrow \\infty$, all the harmonic wavelets are in phase and are superimposed constructively. This condition is called phase matching. Under phase matching, the harmonic amplitude grows in proportion to $z$, as shown in Fig. 11 (a), and therefore, efficient SHG takes place. Equation (63) shows that the SHG efficiency in NPDA under phase matching is proportional to the pump power, the square of the coupling coefficient, and the square of the interaction length.\n",

    "If $\\bm{\\beta}^{2\\omega} \\neq 2\\bm{\\beta}^{\\omega}$ ($N^{2\\omega} \\neq N^{\\omega}$) so that $\\Delta \\neq 0$, the harmonic wavelets are dephased from each other and are superimposed destructively. The harmonic amplitude ripples with a period corresponding to two times coherence length, as shown in Fig. 11 (b), but does not grow with propagation. The constructive superposition takes place only with the wavelets generated within the coherence length, and the wavelets generated in the next coherence length cancel out the previous wavelets. Therefore, if the phase mismatch $\\Delta$ is large, SHG is not substantially accomplished."

    "\n",
    "This result shows that, when $\\Delta = 0$ holds with (2.67), the harmonic wave propagation phase matches one of the spatial harmonics of the nonlinear polarization of harmonic wavelength, and efficient SHG takes place. This is called quasi-phase matching (QPM) or grating phase matching. The wave vector diagram is shown in Fig. 2.13 (c). QPM may be considered compensation for the wave-vector difference between nonlinear polarization and harmonic waves by the grating vector $K$. The device configuration will be shown in the next chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The period for first-order QPM coincides with two times the coherence length given by (2.65). This relation can be used to explain QPM in an alternative way. After constructive NLO interaction within the coherence length, the sign of $d$ is inverted within the next coherence length in order to convert the otherwise destructive contribution to constructive one, and the same process is repeated periodically to accumulate substantially the NLO interaction [2.21]. The above spatial harmonics interpretation is more general and useful for cases of high efficiency where the interaction length is much larger than the coherence length. As we will see in detail in the next chapter, QPM can be accomplished not only with periodic inversion of nonlinear permittivity but also with more general periodic modulation of nonlinear and/or linear permittivities.\n",
    "\n",
    "QPM was first proposed in bulk configurations [2.21], but is now widely applied in both bulk and waveguide configurations. Although QPM requires a periodic structure, it offers a number of advantages. One of them is that matching can be accomplished at any wavelength in the transparency region of the medium by only appropriate design of the QPM period. This is a very important advantage from the device implementation point of view. Matching can be accomplished with arbitrary combinations of mode and polarization. This means that the largest element of the SHG tensor can be used. The largest element of many NLO crystals is a diagonal element, which cannot be used for birefringence phase matching. Use of the largest tensor element, along with use of fundamental modes for pump and harmonic waves of large mode overlap, allows a large coupling coefficient, and therefore, high efficiency. The possibility of using chirped or spatially-modulated grating structures provides additional design flexibility.\n",
    "QPM is therefore the most versatile phase matching technique for implementation of paractical devices, only if the technique to form the periodic structure is found."
