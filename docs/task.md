**Subject: Locating solutions in a complex loss landscape**

**System:**
*   **Algorithm:** L-BFGS
*   **Parameters:** High-dimensional vector `w`

**Behavior:**
*   The optimizer converges to a local minimum.
*   The resulting `w` is jagged and provides a suboptimal objective value.
*   The final solution is sensitive to initialization.

**Hypothesis:**
The loss landscape contains many local minima corresponding to jagged parameter vectors. Broader basins corresponding to smoother vectors exist.

**Request:**
What techniques can alter the search dynamics or the effective loss landscape to favor the discovery of these smoother solutions?
