# Objective
Instead of maximizing power at a single point, I want to achieve a broad, flat-top THW conversion spectrum over a defined range of wavelengths, while maintaining high efficiency.
# Task
Propose a differentiable mathematical method to quantitatively evaluate the broad, flat-top spectrum.
