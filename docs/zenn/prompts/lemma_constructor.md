Given this essence of functionality: [{CLIPBOARD}]
Help me generate a name for a composable unit that:
1. Represents a single, focused capability or responsibility
2. Is modular and can be composed with other units
3. Describes what it does, not how it does it
4. Captures the core concept regardless of implementation or language
Guidelines:
- Use clear, descriptive terms
- Focus on the capability/behavior
- Should be composable with other units
- Avoid implementation details
- Keep it concise (preferably 2-3 words)
Please provide:
1. Recommended name
2. Why this name represents the core capability
3. How it could compose with other potential units
