Given the following [{CLIPBOARD}], help me extract its essential elements:
1. First, identify and list any specific technologies or implementation details:
[List them without explanation]
2. Now, rewrite the requirement by:
- Removing all listed technologies
- Replacing implementation-specific terms with generic concepts
- Preserving original terminology and language where possible
3. Express the essence in a single statement that:
- Uses the original language and terminology (do not translate or rephrase)
- Is technology-neutral
- Captures the fundamental goal
- Could be implemented in multiple ways
- Maintains the original tone and style of expression
4. Finally, verify this essence by asking:
- Does it maintain the original intent?
- Is it free from specific solutions?
- Could it apply across different contexts?
- Does it preserve the original language and expressions?
Present the final essential statement in under 30 words, using the exact language style of the original requirement.
