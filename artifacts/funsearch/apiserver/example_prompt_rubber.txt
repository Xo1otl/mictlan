"""
Discover a mathematical function to predict the tensile modulus of a particle-filler rubber composite.
The function must be based on established physical models.
You are given the following variables:
- phi: The filler volume fraction (the primary input).
- E_m: The tensile modulus of the matrix (4.84).
- E_f: The tensile modulus of the filler (117.64).
- E_composite: The modded Reuss model.
Your task is to evolve the function `E_composite = f(phi, params, E_m, E_f)`.
Start with the provided Reuss model. You can introduce up to MAX_NPARAMS
optimizable parameters (from the `params` array) to modify or extend the Reuss model
to achieve a better fit with the experimental data. For instance, you could try
scaling it, adding terms, or modifying its components. The goal is to find a
physically meaningful improvement to the basic Reuss model.

    Mathematical function for the tensile modulus of a particle-filler rubber composite.

    This function aims to model the relationship between the filler volume fraction (phi)
    and the experimentally observed tensile modulus. The evolution should be based on
    the Reuss model, which defines the lower bound for the composite's elastic modulus.

    The Reuss model ($E_{\text{lower}}$) is given by:
    $E_{\text{lower}} = \frac{E_m E_f}{(1-\phi)E_f + \phi E_m}$

    The core of this function, to be evolved by FunSearch, **must use** the provided
    tensile modulus of the matrix (E_m), the filler (E_f), and the volume fraction (phi).
    It is strongly encouraged to incorporate the Reuss model structure. The goal is to
    build upon or modify this physical model to better fit the data, potentially using
    the optimizable `params`.

    Args:
        volume_fraction: A numpy array representing the filler volume fraction (phi).
        params: Array of numeric constants (at most MAX_NPARAMS) to be optimized.
        E_m: Tensile modulus of the matrix (fixed at 4.84).
        E_f: Tensile modulus of the filler (fixed at 117.64).

    Return:
        A numpy array for the predicted tensile modulus (E_composite).

Implement `equation_v1` by **modifying its calculation logic** for improvement.
Please provide ONLY the Python code for the improved function, including the `def` header, enclosed in a code block.
